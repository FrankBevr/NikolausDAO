Frank and Botond's journey through the hackathon was a remarkable blend of
collaboration, innovation, and technological exploration. Their adventure began
with "Skratch Idea," where they brainstormed and refined their concept. They
added a DAO to a 3D model, came up with an implementation for the DAO, and
created a software design document. After sharing this document in their group
and receiving feedback, they processed the suggestions and improved their idea.

The duo then formed a partnership, marking the "Group up" phase of their
project. This collaboration led to the "Reshape Idea" stage, where they
integrated AI into their 3D printed DAO concept. They experimented with various
technologies like stable diffusion dreamfusion and tested their idea with
creative models like sharks and goblins. After numerous tests and discussions,
they sought feedback on their project named "Neverland," and finally took a
well-deserved rest.

In the "Adjust Idea" phase, Frank and Botond exchanged ideas for improvements.
Botond addressed a security issue with the centralized node, while Frank
contributed an AI model incentive. They added the concept of stake-based
decentralization to their NikolausDAO and planned the next steps of their
project on pen and paper.

Their "First Steps" involved setting up a GitHub repository, with both Frank and
Botond committing their initial code. They also added essential documents like
'SoftwareDesign.md' and 'Organisation.org' to their repository. Botond took the
lead in setting up the AI-Node & Thingies, where he wrote a README, set up node
and python applications, and established a frontend. They received feedback from
their colleague Gabo and delved into contracts.

Both Frank and Botond worked on the "Walkthrough Smartcontract" phase, where
they created, built, and deployed a SmartContract. They interacted with it
through various interfaces and wrote a Polkadot JS node application. Despite
encountering some problems, they persevered. Frank attended Eugen's amazing
workshop, learning about git repositories, contract deployment, and debugging.

In the "Contract V1" stage, they created NikolausDAO, added members, prompts,
and gifts, and defined setters and getters. They also began integrating the AI
node with the smart contract. The "NodeJS" phase saw them setting up a backend,
installing PolkaJS, getting accounts and blockhashes, and adding a readContract
function.

Their journey continued with "Contract V2," where they added nodes, statuses for
pending, accepting, and rejected states, chunked data into Gifts structs, and
thoroughly tested their contract via the contracts UI.

The "Second Part" of their journey focused on finalizing the contract,
integrating the AI node with the Smart Contract, and working on the frontend.
Botond removed structs, updated layouts, added voting and error handling
mechanisms. He also added member registration functionalities and debugged them.
Frank contributed by collecting addresses and prompts, adding read functions to
the backend, deploying the frontend, and writing a proposal.

The "Last Day" was a culmination of their hard work. They added error handling
to the frontend, tested it extensively, and prepared a script for a video
presentation. They also made a video, prepared a presentation with slides, and
updated their software design document. Their final tasks involved finding a
print lab, updating their readme, uploading their video, and recalling and
adding their organization file.

Their journey was a testament to the power of collaboration, creativity, and
technology in transforming ideas into tangible projects. Frank and Botond's
hackathon experience was not just about coding and development; it was a story
of learning, adapting, and innovating in a dynamic environment.
