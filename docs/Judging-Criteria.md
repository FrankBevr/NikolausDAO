### Judging criteria

Judges will score each team's project based on the following criteria:

- Idea, ecosystem fit
    - Is it a realistic project and would it be useful for the ecosystem?
- Logic flow and topology
    - Is the logic flow of the program well thought out?
    - If this is a proof of concept, did the team think about making the flow better?
    - Note: drawing a high-level logic topology is not a must, but good to have
- Presented demo and code
    - Did the demo work?
    - How well-written is the code?
    - Note: the code does not need to be long, but working and should be written during the hackathon.
    - Libs/StackOverflow/etc parts are fine, but there needs to be original code.
- Viability and sustainability
    - If the presented project would get funding, would it be sustainable in the long run?
    - Would anyone keep this project running, would it be interesting enough for the community/users?
- Practicality
    - When it comes to using the project, would it be practical or burdensome?
    - Note: the proof of concept doesn't need to be like that, but knowing that future improvements would make the project practical is important.
- Security Model
    - How is the project protected against threats and abuse?
- Second challenge proposal
    - Did the team present a realistic idea for the other track?
    - Note: don't spend more than an hour as a team on this, but make sure to do it. 5/5 is the maximum score for this proposal.

Each criterion has a maximum score of 10 and the judges will decide individually how many scores they vote for the teams. The maximum score a team can get for their main project is 70. After the scores are finalized, they will be presented in the Hall of Fame smart contract.
We don't help with solving the challenges, but if something is unclear or you think you've found a bug, we are always open to hear from you.
